Ayuda is designed to support a range of Creating Standards & Sharing Knowledge for public health use cases. Currently the main build uses GPS for location tracking. Our roadmap includes adding support for other location and proximity technologies, symptom tracking, and communication with PHAs.



Project deals with State of the art Technology chatbots need an upgrade, and the good news is they’re getting one. Technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and more robust network connectivity are opening up a new dimension for today’s traditional robotic, web-based chatbots. Chatbots integrated with these technologies can leverage the support 5G technology have the ability to advance businesses as the main motive of bottom line is to lending hand of human connection.

AR and chatbots are perhaps two of the most promising avenues while creating new horizons in the current digital world. Both solutions have their range of applicability which could help businesses get more profitable and the customers satisfied. Since customers today are used to communicating with chatbots about their inquiries while at a store or website, adding augmented reality would take it a notch higher. When these two technologies are combined, they create a range of possibilities that have not been utilized before.

This Code Pattern is a demonstration of Avatar based Chatbot, an android mobile Chatbot Application with AI and AR capabilities which dynamically fetches the information using APIs in Watson Assistant via Webhooks(Cloud Functions).

End-to-End System
Ayuda is designed to work with Safe Places, a tool for contact tracing teams to work with location data in the course of contact tracing interviews and to publish points of concern. Without having to sharing their own location history, a Ayuda user can download the points of concern from their PHA to identify if they have had risk of an exposure.
